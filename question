Question:
Design and Implement a System for Managing Traffic Fines 
You are tasked with designing a Traffic Fine Management System using object
oriented programming concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction (or 
interfaces). The system should enforce strict validation and include exception 
handling. 
Requirements: 
1. Class Definitions: 
o Person (Base Class): 
 Attributes: 
 name (String) 
 licenseNumber (String) 
 Methods: 
 Constructor: To initialize the attributes. 
 displayDetails(): Abstract method to display details. 
o Driver (Derived Class from Person): 
 Additional Attributes: 
 totalFines (double): Total fine amount for the driver. 
 violationCount (int): Count of traffic violations. 
 Methods: 
 Constructor: Initializes attributes of Driver including 
base class attributes. 
 addViolation(fineAmount: double): Adds a violation fine 
to the driver and increments the violation count. Ensure 
the fine is positive. 
 resetViolations(): Resets the violation count and total 
fines. 
 displayDetails(): Implements the abstract method to 
display all driver details. 
o TrafficViolation (Base Class or Interface): 
 Methods: 
 validateViolation(): Abstract method to validate if the 
violation type and fine are correct. 
o SpecificViolation (Derived Class from TrafficViolation): 
 Attributes: 
 violationType (String): Type of violation (e.g., 
"Speeding", "Parking", etc.). 
 fineAmount (double): Fine amount for the violation. 
 Methods: 
 Constructor: To initialize violation details. 
 validateViolation(): Ensures the fine amount is non
negative and that the violation type is from a predefined 
list (e.g., "Speeding", "Parking", etc.). 
 getViolationDetails(): Returns violation details as a 
string. 
2. Validation Rules: 
o licenseNumber should be alphanumeric and 8-12 characters long. 
o fineAmount must be greater than zero. 
o violationType must be one of the valid types: "Speeding", "Parking", 
"Signal Violation". 
3. Exception Handling: 
o Throw an exception if: 
 fineAmount is negative or zero. 
 licenseNumber format is invalid. 
 violationType is not in the predefined list. 
o Handle exceptions to print meaningful error messages. 
4. Execution Flow: 
o Create multiple drivers with license numbers and add traffic violations 
for them. 
o Validate violation details before adding them to the driver. 
o Display all details for each driver including their total fines and 
violations. 
o Reset violations for a specific driver and demonstrate the system's 
functionality.
